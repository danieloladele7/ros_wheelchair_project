    "### ROS Noetic Basics:\n",
    "##### High Level Overview:\n",
    "1. **ROS Master**: Keeps track of all robot processes\n",
    "2. **Nodes**: Executed (Executable) codes utilizing ROS.\n",
    "3. **Publishers | Subscriber**: Nodes can publish data through a communication pipeline called **Topics** for subscribers to process. e.g `camera.py` (publisher node) making available images (which are referred to as **Messages**) for `detect_objects.py` (subscriber node). Publishers can make **messages** available to **multiple** subscribers.\n",
    "4. **Services**: Nodes **request** data, and other nodes send a **single response** per requests.\n",
    "5. **Actions**: Nodes sets a **goal**, and receives **feedback** until **result** (e.g a picture) is given.\n",
    "6. **Parameter Server**: Central hub to get or modify robot parameters. e,g telling the parameter server to specific wheels size.\n",
    "7. **Bag Files**: Save (Record) and Playback multiple data being published.\n",
    "8. **Packages**: Distribution method of ROS code.\n",

    "##### ROS Simulation and Viz Overview:\n",
    "1. Gazebo: [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/) is a free-to-use robot simulator which is able to communicate data over ROS. It is able to keep track of robot positions, as well as mimic the state of a real robot. It includes virtual sensors which can be used to simulate real sensor data so that you are able to test your robot code as if you were running it on a physical robotic system.\n",
    "2. RViz: [RViz](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz) is a 3D data visualization software suite which also interacts with data over ROS. RViz comes with data visualization features, as well as other localization based tools for you to interact with your robot, especially of one in simulation.\n",
    "3. RQT: [RQT](http://wiki.ros.org/rqt) is plugin based graphical user interface to be used with ROS. It comes with various graphical plugins, such as a topic publisher, image viewer, parameter updater, node graph visualizer, and much more. It is worth noting that RViz and RQT have certain features with both software suites can perform.\n",

    "A standardized guide to make your code readable.\n",
    "1. Name Conventions: (You can use betty style code). Examples.\n",
    "    - `pkg_names`, `topic_names`, `variable_names` are all **under_scores**. Check the style guide for more. \n",
    "    - Files should be descriptive, `executable.cpp` and `header.h`.\n",
    "    - Classes are `CamelCased`.\n",
    "    - Functions are `camelCased`.\n",
    "2. Messages Types: for publisher and subscribers.\n",
    "    - [Message](http://wiki.ros.org/msg)/[sensor_msgs](http://wiki.ros.org/sensor_msgs) Types can be created, but you can make use of the many available message types in ROS. Accessing them are all done in the same manner. `#include \"std_msgs/Bool.h\"`, instanciate it `std_msgs::Bool bool_msg;`, access/load and/or assign to the data attribute `bool_msg.data = true`. Some example types -> for GPS `NavSatFix` to display lat, long and covariances, for camera `CompressedImage and Image`, for LiDAR `LaserScan` for single point LiDAR and `PointCloud` for 3D point  LiDAR e.t.c.\n",
